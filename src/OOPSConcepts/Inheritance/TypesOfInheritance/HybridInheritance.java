    /**What all can be done in a Subclass?

     In sub-classes we can inherit members as is, replace them, hide them, or supplement them with new members:

     The inherited fields can be used directly, just like any other fields.
     We can declare new fields in the subclass that are not in the superclass.
     The inherited methods can be used directly as they are.
     We can write a new instance method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus overriding it (as in example above, toString() method is overridden).
     We can write a new static method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus hiding it.
     We can declare new methods in the subclass that are not in the superclass.
     We can write a subclass constructor that invokes the constructor of the superclass, either implicitly or by using the keyword super.**/
