/**In Multilevel Inheritance, a derived class will be inheriting a base class and as well as the derived class also act as the base class to other class.
 * In below image, the class A serves as a base class for the derived class B, which in turn serves as a base class for the derived class C.
 * In Java, a class cannot directly access the grandparentâ€™s members.
 *
 * Class A(Base Class) -----------------------> Class B(Intermediary Class) --------------------------> Class C(Derived Class) **/
