/**Java also includes another version of for loop introduced in Java 5.
 * Enhanced for loop provides a simpler way to iterate through the elements of a collection or array.
 * It is inflexible and should be used only when there is a need to iterate through the elements in sequential manner without knowing the index of currently processed element.
 * Also note that the object/variable is immutable when enhanced for loop is used i.e it ensures that the values in the array can not be modified,
 * so it can be said as read only loop where you canâ€™t update the values as opposite to other loops where values can be modified.
 * We recommend using this form of the for statement instead of the general form whenever possible.(as per JAVA doc.)
 *
 * Syntax:
 * for (T element:Collection obj/array)
 * {
 *     statement(s)
 * }**/
