------------------------------------------------------------ Variable -------------------------------------------------
A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.
* The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.
* A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location.
* In Java, all the variables must be declared before use.

-------------------How to Declare Basics.Variables.----------------
int age = 20;  Where, int is DataType, age is VariableName, 20 is VariableValue, We can change the value of of the variable in runtime.

Now In RAM Reserved Memory for Variable is hold one value that name is age and value is 20 and its take space around 32Bit or less.
Because int Hold 32Bit of Data.

datatype: Type of data that can be stored in this variable.
variable_name: Name given to the variable.
value: It is the initial value stored in the variable.

Examples:

float simpleInterest; //Declaring float variable
int time = 10, speed = 20; //Declaring and Initializing integer variable
char var = 'h'; // Declaring and Initializing character variable



There are three types of variables in Java:
Local Basics.Variables
Instance Basics.Variables
Static Basics.Variables


ScopeofVariable
Scope of a variable is the part of the program where the variable is accessible.
Like C/C++, in Java, all identifiers are lexically (or statically) scoped,
i.e.scope of a variable can determined at compile time and independent of function call stack.
Java programs are organized in the form of classes. Every class is part of some package.
Java scope rules can be covered under following categories.

There're Three Types Types of Variable Scope
Member Basics.Variables or Global Basics.Variables (Class Level Scope)
Local Basics.Variables (Method Level Scope)
Loop Basics.Variables (Block Scope)
