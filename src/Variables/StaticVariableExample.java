package Variables;

/**Static variables are also known as Class variables.
 * These variables are declared similarly as instance variables, the difference is that static variables are declared using the static keyword within a class outside any method constructor or block.
 * Unlike instance variables, we can only have one copy of a static variable per class irrespective of how many objects we create.
 * Static variables are created at the start of program execution and destroyed automatically when execution ends.
 * Initialisation of Static Variable is not Mandatory. Its default value is 0.
 * If we access the static variable like Instance variable (through an object), the compiler will show the warning message and it wonâ€™t halt the program. The compiler will replace the object name to class name automatically.
 * If we access the static variable without the class name, Compiler will automatically append the class name.
 *
 * To access static variables, we need not create an object of that class, we can simply access the variable as
 * class_name.variable_name;
