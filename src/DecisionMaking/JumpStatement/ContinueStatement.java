/**Sometimes it is useful to force an early iteration of a loop.
 * That is, you might want to continue running the loop but stop processing the remainder of the code in its body for this particular iteration.
 * This is, in effect, a goto just past the body of the loop, to the loopâ€™s end.
 * The continue statement performs such an action.**/
