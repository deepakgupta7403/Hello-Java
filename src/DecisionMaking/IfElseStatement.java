/**The if statement alone tells us that if a condition is true it will execute a block of statements and if the condition is false it wonâ€™t.
 * But what if we want to do something else if the condition is false.
 * Here comes the else statement. We can use the else statement with if statement to execute a block of code when the condition is false.
 *
 Syntax:
 if (condition)
 {
 // Executes this block if
 // condition is true
 }
 else
 {
 // Executes this block if
 // condition is false
 }**/

public class IfElseStatement {
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        int i = 10;

        if (i < 15)
            System.out.println("i is smaller than 15");
        else
            System.out.println("i is greater than 15");
    }


    //OUTPUT
    //i is smaller than 15
}
