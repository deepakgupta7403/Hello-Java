package Comments;

/**To describe a full method in a code or a complex snippet single line comments can be tedious to write, since we have to give ‘//’ at every line. So to overcome this multi line comments can be used.
 Syntax:

 /*Comment starts
 continues
 continues
 .
 .
 .
 Commnent ends**/

public class MultiLineComment {
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        System.out.println("Multi line comments below");
        /*Comment line 1
          Comment line 2
          Comment line 3*/
    }



//    We can also accomplish single line comments by using the above syntax as shown below:

    /*Comment line 1*/
}
